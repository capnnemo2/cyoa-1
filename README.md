# CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE

A simple proof-of-concept. This project gave me an opportunity to relive the childhood glory of a genius combination of reading and playing a game. It also allowed me to practice with React doing things like:

- Creating reusable components
- Utilizing context and state

Now that I have a better understanding of how complicated the storylines can get in a Choose Your Own Adventure story I have mad respect for anyone who creates a longer adventure. Maybe someday I'll expand this adventure!
