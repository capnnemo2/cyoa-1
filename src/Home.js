          Choose Your Own Adventure books were pretty exciting when I discovered
          them in elementary school. They were a way to basically play a video
          or computer game through a book. I though they were awesome. I wanted
          to create one as a web app. Of course, this is right on the line of
          creating an actual game. As such, as the project advances, it may
          eventually blur the line. But to begin, a simple CYOA story!
